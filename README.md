# LibretroUnityFE

This is a Unity sandboxed project to help create a [Unity/C#](https://unity.com/) based [libretro](https://www.libretro.com/) core "launcher" (or "frontend", in libretro's terms).

The goal is to have this fully integrated within the [3DArcade](http://3darcade.messageboard.nl/index.php) frontend, in order to have playable games on 3D models inside virtual arcade environments.
